Learning MuleSoft fundamentals

Hello everyone!

This repository is my first endeavor on GitHub; I'm taking the first steps in learning what it takes to become a successful software developer.  Currently I am
learning the fundamentals of MuleSoft along with JavaScript, using Terminal, JSON and XML, etc.  I'm definitely a beginner, but I love a challenge! Learning new
concepts and skills is a passion of mine. 

My background is in Medical Laboratory Science (mostly in the discipline of microbiology), but I can see an opportunity to apply skills I've developed in my previous
employment towards this new career path.

My goal is to become a certified MuleSoft Developer and continually build my knowledge and experience to become a valuable asset to the team I ultimately join.

I welcome all constructive criticism, advice and any wisdom that more experienced devs will offer!  Please feel free to reach out to me @ brittany.lightner@cchsmail.org

Looking forward to connecting, learning and collaborating!
